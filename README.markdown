# dotfiles

Just some of my local configuration files. 

At the moment it's pretty much just vim, but eventually I'd like to include all of them.

## Installation

At the moment, just symlink ~/.vimrc and ~/.gvimrc to vimrc and gvimrc.

Ultimately, I'd like to add a shell script or rake task to handle this.
