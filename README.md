# dotfiles

Just some of my local configuration files.

Included right now there are settings for vim, ack, and rubygems, but I'll be
adding more as I get to it.

## Installation

I use [GNU Stow][0] to manage my dotfiles.

To install, just clone the repo, `cd` into it, and run `stow zsh vim other`, or
whichever sets you want to install.
